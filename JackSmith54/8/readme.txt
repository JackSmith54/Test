I am using a 78000 word book to get as many words as I can to get a more acurate probability.

I have also attatched a 1000word file in case you wanted to use that instead as a smaller corpus.

For this to be accurate, in my checkProb function, "d = map.get(check.get(i))/78000;" would have to be changed to d = map.get(check.get(i))/1000;
