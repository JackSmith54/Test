# Feedback (Jack Smith)


## N-Queens

* Out of the box your program only solves N=5.
* Needed to edit source for other cases.
* A command line argument to get N would have been a better solution.
* Code to display board should be in a method.
* You should not have hard coded the results for N < 4 
* Good output.

## Knight's Tour

* Start position is hardcoded.
* Output format good, but single digits distort the layout.
* Very slow.
* Some starting positions do not produce a result in any reasonable time. 
* You need a better algorithm.
